## Simple IMDB Top Movies Generator with BeautifulSoup

I love to automate things. Fortunately, I can do a lot of automation with Python. One of the magic that Python has it BeautifulSoup module. This repo is a source for Python script to scrape IMDB site based on year input and generate an excel file (from **pandas** and **openpyxl**) for top 50 movies on that year.

Useful legend:
* **imdb top movies {year}.xlsx** - Sample generated list
* **imdb-top-movies.py** - Python script
